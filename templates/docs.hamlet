  <h1>Carnival User Guide

  <article>
    <p>

      Carnival is an unobtrusive, developer-friendly way to add comments to any
      web site.

    <p>

      Installation is easy. Once you've 
      <a href=@{SitesR}>created a Site
      , just add the following HTML snippet to the bottom of your page:

    <pre>
      <code>
        \&lt;script src="#{root}/sites/YOUR-SITE-ID/init.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        \&lt;script&gt;
        \  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", Carnival.init);
        \&lt;/script&gt;

    <p>

      By default, a hidden sidebar will be added to any 
      <code>article
      elements. Within these elements, each 
      <code>p
      and 
      <code>pre
      element will receive a small indicator, visible on hover. When clicked, the
      sidebar will expand, allowing visitors to comment on that specific portion
      of your article.

    <p>

      Carnival also sends email notifications on replies and provides an RSS feed
      of recent comments on your Site.

    <p>

      This page itself has Carnival loaded. Feel free to add comments and 
      <a href=view-source:@{DocsR}>view-source
      to see how it works.

    <h2>Options

    <p>
      <code>Carnival.init
      accepts an options object with any of the following keys:

    <table .table>
      <tr>
        <th>Option
        <th>Default Value
        <th>Description
      <tr>
        <td><code>enabled</code>
        <td><code>true</code>
        <td>Add Carnival on this page?
      <tr>
        <td><code>article_author</code>
        <td><code>""</code>
        <td>The Article author. Used in the Comments Feed.
      <tr>
        <td><code>article_selector</code>
        <td><code>"article"</code>
        <td>The CSS selector used to find the Article element.
      <tr>
        <td><code>block_selector</code>
        <td><code>":scope > p, :scope > pre"</code>
        <td>
          The CSS selector used to find elements within the Article on which to
          add comment Threads. When this selector is used, 
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:scope">
            <code>:scope
          will refer to your Article element.
      <tr>
        <td><code>shift_article</code>
        <td><code>true</code>
        <td>
          Automatically shift your Article element to make room for the comments
          UI.
      <tr>
        <td><code>force_relative</code>
        <td><code>true</code>
        <td>
          Force your Article element to be 
          <code>position: relative
          .
      <tr>
        <td><code>onNewComment</code>
        <td><code>function(comment) { };</code>
        <td>A callback invoked whenever comments are inserted in the DOM.

    <p>
      To pass options, you'll need to modify your event handler like so:

    <pre>
      <code>
        \document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        \  Carnival.init({
        \    enabled: true,
        \    article_author: "",
        \    article_selector: "article",
        \    block_selector: ":scope > p, :scope > pre",
        \    shift_article: true,
        \    force_relative: true,
        \    onNewComment: function(comment) { };
        \  });
        \});

    <h2>Impact on the DOM

    <p>

      Carnival will insert an element to contain the comment threads and form.
      This new element will be the first child of your Article element and have
      the class 
      <code>carnival
      . To support the positioning of this element, Carnival must ensure that
      your Article element is 
      <code>position: relative
      . This can be disabled with the 
      <code>force_relative
      option.

    <p>

      Carnival will add sibling elements after each commentable block to hold the
      comment indicator and count. These elements will have the class 
      <code>carnival-comment-indicator
      .

    <p>

      When comments are opened, Carnival will add a 
      <code>commenting
      class to your Article element. To make room for itself, Carnival will shift
      your Article element 
      <code>150
      pixels to the left. It does this by taking the element's current 
      <code>style.left
      value and setting a new one 150 pixels less. This can be disabled with the 
      <code>shift_article
      option.

    <h2>Comments Feed

    <p>

      Each Site comes with a Comments Feed of the 20 most recent comments for that
      Site. You can find it at 
      <code>#{root}/sites/YOUR-SITE-ID/feed
      . This is provided so you can implement automation via 
      <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier
      or 
      <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT
      .
